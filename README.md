# Welcome to this portfolio
I have a short portfolio displaying some photographs that I took in Ottawa. 
During the process, I learnt a lot about Bootstrap and how the library can save a lot of time wasted in design of the website, and through Bootstrap, a clean and responsive website could be easily made. One challenge that I faced during development was the contact form, though I learnt about the form-control class which was then used to give a nice looking contact form. I have tried giving the website a minimal look.
The majority of the framework was done through Bootstrap. All images were mine and no stock images were added. Monterrat designed by Julieta Ulanovsky, Sol Matas, Juan Pablo del Peral, Jacques Le Bailly was used as the font from Google Fonts.
